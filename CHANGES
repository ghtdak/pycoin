Version 0.13
------------

* first crack at support for Python 2.7
* rename ripemd160_sha256 to hash160
* add a bunch of pydoc comments
* first crack at genwallet.py utility (need a better name)
* very preliminary crack at spend.py utility
* reduce Tx database that's required to be passed to the "sign" method
  to include bare minimum of data (the output script for a given hash/index)
* change ":pub" keypath suffix to ".pub" (still not sure about this)
* lots of refactoring, parameter renaming, moving things around
  related to signing and verifying transactions. Better, but still
  not perfect.
